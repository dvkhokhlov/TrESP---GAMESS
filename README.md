TrESP-GAMESS is simple utility using GAMESS-US output for derivation non-diagonal elements of electrostatic potential matix.

It works with modified GAMESS which capable to write transition density matrix. 
In order to patch GAMESS tddft code, use tddft.patch. Another qm methods can be modified in the same manner.
